# INSTALLATION

##### Install the calendar widget using the following commands
```
pip install calendar_widget
```

# USAGE

#### First, Import the calendar widget along with tkinter
```
import tkinter
from calendar_widget import Calendar
```

##### Define the tkinter window into which the widget will be placed. EXAMPLE:
```
root = tkinter.Tk()
root.geometry('600x600')
```

##### The Calendar Widget can then be created as follows:
```
Calendar = Calendar(root)
```

##### To pass a command to the Calendar, specify the command option when it is created
```
Calendar = Calendar(root, command=user_command, ...)
```

##### To retrieve a selected date on the calendar, use the get_date command:
```
Calender.get_date()
```

##### To create a checkbox on the calendar, the command is as follows:
```
checkbox = Calendar.checkboxes(10, 10, 2022, status=True, ...)

#to remove a chcekbox that has already been created specify the delete option as follows:

Calendar.checkboxes(10, 10, 2022, delete=True)
```

##### To destroy the calendar widget, call the destroy method:
```
Calendar.destroy()
```

## Example 1 - Basic Setup

```
# import tkinter and the calendar widget
import tkinter
from calendar_widget import Calendar

# define the main window into which the widget will be placed
root = tkinter.Tk()
root.geometry('600x600')  # the geometry function defines the size of the tkinter window
                          # - in this case, we are using a window that is 600px by 600px

# create the calendar widget
Calendar = Calendar(root, # specify the tkinter window into which the widget will be placed
	size = 250, # set the size of the calendar widget to 250px
	pos_x = 0, # set the x position of the calendar widget within the tkinter window
	pos_y = 0, # set the y position of the calendar widget within the tkinter window
	background = 'lightblue', # set the background of the calendar to light blue
	)

# remember to call your mainloop function so that the tkinter window is persistent
root.mainloop()
```

Note: if no 'pos_x' or 'pos_y' parameters are given, the Calendar widget will default to using the standard pack function.
