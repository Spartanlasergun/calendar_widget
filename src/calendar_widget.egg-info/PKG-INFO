```
Calendar = Calendar(root, command=user_command, ...)
```

```
Calender.get_date()
```

```
checkbox = Calendar.checkboxes(10, 10, 2022, status=True, ...)

#to remove a chcekbox that has already been created specify the delete option as follows:

Calendar.checkboxes(10, 10, 2022, delete=True)
